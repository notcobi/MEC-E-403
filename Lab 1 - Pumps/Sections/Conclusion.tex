\noindent From the calibration, the thermocouple with the linear fit had the best accuracy, repeatability, and resolution.
The thermistor had the worst accuracy, repeatability, and resolution. The thermocouple also had a lower time constant
than the thermistor in both air and water. The thermocouple with the linear fit performed better than with the Adafruit
conversion equation. This was because the linear fit was tailored to the calibration data. Further work on the worse performance
of the thermistor could be investigated in future labs.

The results were obtained in the small temperature range of 21.2$^\circ$C to 54.1$^\circ$C. The accuracy, repeatability, and resolution
may change outside of this range. This report recommends using the thermocouple with the linear fit for temperature measurements.

This lab introduced the concept of temperature sensors, calibration, and step response. The thermistor and thermocouple
were calibrated and their step response was measured. Further work into RTD and different thermistor materials
could be done to understand the differences between temperature sensors.
