\section{Introduction}
The focus of this lab was to analyze the performance of centrifugal pumps at different operating speeds, valve orientations, along with both parallel and series configurations. The data obtained from the lab testing is used to determine head, flow, and efficiency. The lab results are compared with the manufacturer provided data sheets and theoretical calculations. The parameters measured during each test are the moment arm, time to collect water (200lbs), and the transducer reading. The goal of determining the performance of different pumping configurations is useful for understanding how to achieve optimal efficiency in a piping system, and the effect certain factors (i.e., pump speed) have.
