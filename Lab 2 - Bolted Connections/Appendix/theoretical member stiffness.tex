\section{Appendix: Theoretical Member Stiffness Calculations}
\label{sec:theoretical_member_stiffness}

From Eq. (\ref{eq:member_stiffness}), the stiffness of the member was estimated to be, 
\begin{align*}
    k_{m, \text{th}} &= \frac{\pi E_b d}{2\ln\left(\frac{5(L+0.5d)}{L+2.5d}\right)}
\end{align*}
where $E_b$ is the modulus of elasticity of the bolt, $d$ is the diameter of the bolt, and $L$ is the length of the member. The modulus of elasticity of the bolt was determined to be $\qty{205.046}{\giga\pascal}$ in Appendix \ref{sec:modulus_of_elasticity}. The diameter of the bolt was $\qty{0.371}{\inch}$ and the length of the member was $\qty{63.5}{\milli\meter}$. Then,
\begin{align*}
    k_{m, \text{th}} &= \frac{\pi \times \qty{205.046}{\giga\pascal} \times \qty{0.371}{\inch} \times \qty{25.4}{\milli\meter\per\inch}}{2\ln\left(\frac{5(\qty{63.5}{\milli\meter}+0.5\times\qty{0.371}{\inch}\times \qty{25.4}{\milli\meter\per\inch})}{\qty{63.5}{\milli\meter}+2.5\times\qty{0.371}{\inch}\times \qty{25.4}{\milli\meter\per\inch}}\right)} \\
   % &= 2222.774274
    &= \boxed{\qty{2222.774}{\mega\newton\per\meter}}
\end{align*}
