feedback from report 1 
- improve abstract, worth 15% for some reason (-5%)
    - discuss all "items to consider" in the abstract 
- make sure list of figures and list of tables are on seperate pages
- improve introduction (-3%)
    - talk about background
    - talk about what exactly is being measured
    - talk about what will be calculated
    - talk about industry applications. cite a textbook or something
    - basically make it an abstract without the numbers or the "answer items to consider"
- results and discussion (-7%)
    - use line of best fit for curves (to be clarified. did they want second order fit?)
    - include values?
    - reference theory section in discussion
    - make up reasons for why pump was not meeting expected values
- conclusion (-1%)
    - idfk what they want
- appendix
    - discuss the major sources of error i guess ?????


questions for TA for report 2
- Plots
    - do the plots look about right?
    - is there an expected plot for the dynamic data?
- Error propagation
    - is this considered full enough for error propagation?
    - what quantities do we need to calculate the error for other than for the preload vs torque 
- "Using data from the zero preload trial, determine the washer calibration by plotting bridge output against external load." What is washer calibration?
find the linear relationship between the input and external load
item 9, use the post seperation slope
- i used a quadratic fit for gasket, are you supposed to use linear fit so you can calculate the k_m
- do we need to mention the equivalent strain from the shunt resistor?
- general common issues
- prelab marks
