Pumps, turbines, and fans are turbo machines whose function is to change the energy level of a fluid. A pump or compressor increases the total head or pressure of the fluid while a turbine decreases it and extracts energy from the flow. Analysis of turbo machines is an important piece of technology, and a knowledge of their general characteristics is essential for many branches of engineering. 

The geometry of turbo machines varies appreciably for the differing types that have been developed. Broadly there are two classes. In the first class there is a pronounced change in radius from the inlet to the discharge; these may be said to be centrifugal turbo machines. This is an important type of turbo machine as there are a great number of pumps, turbines and compressors that fall into this category. The other class consists of axial machines in which the flow is largely parallel to the axis of rotation. Between these extremes are examples in which the flow may proceed along conical surfaces of revolution, and these are sometimes called mixed-flow turbo machines. In all these varying types, however, there must be a rotating member, usually called a rotor, or impeller, to do work on the fluid.
